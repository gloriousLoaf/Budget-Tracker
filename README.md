## Description
This is an easy to use budgeting app for tracking daily expenses when you are on the go. It meets basic PWA standards, is installable, and uses **IndexedDB** to store transactions when mobile data or wifi are unavailable. The backend is **MongoDB** with Mongoose.js. A line graph adds visualcontext for the user and is created with **Chart.js**.

## Installation
To run this locally, clone this repo and run ``` npm install ``` from your command line, then open a new terminal window and get MongoDB running with ``` mongod ```. In your first terminal, run ``` npm server ``` from the root folder of the app, then navigate to localhost://3000 in your browser to start testing out the app. For production, use your preferred cloud hosting platform to connect to the database. This app is deployed on Heroku, see it in action here ðŸ‘‰ [Budget Tracker](https://budget-tracker-mongodb.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
The user can enter a starting budget for their "wallet", then deduct transactions all through the input forms. The JavaScript and dependencies will take care of the rest.
